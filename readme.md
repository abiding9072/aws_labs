# AWS Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on experience learning Amazon Web Services through practical implementation and experimentation.

## Overview

This collection captures my progression through AWS services and architecture patterns, combining both manual console-based work and infrastructure-as-code approaches. Each lab represents a step in building practical cloud competency.

## Content Structure

- **Manual Labs**: Step-by-step implementations using the AWS Console, including configuration walkthroughs and architectural decisions
- **Terraform Deployments**: Infrastructure-as-code implementations showcasing automated provisioning and resource management
- **Documentation**: Detailed notes on concepts, challenges encountered, and solutions discovered during each lab
- **Visual References**: Screenshots and diagrams illustrating configurations, architectures, and results

## Approach

The labs are hands-on practice for me to learn complex architectural patterns. In addition, I have tried to incorporate my already extensive homelab to enhance the cloud infra scenarios I could practice, such as a Site-to-Site VPN connection with my PfSense home firewall.

## Technologies

- AWS Services
- Terraform for infrastructure automation
- Various supporting tools and frameworks as needed

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning log and a reference for future projects. The code and documentation reflect real implementations and the iterative process of developing cloud infrastructure skills.
