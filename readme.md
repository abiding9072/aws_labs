# AWS Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on experience learning Amazon Web Services through practical implementation and experimentation.

## Overview

This collection captures my progression through AWS services and architecture patterns, combining both manual console-based work and infrastructure-as-code approaches. Each lab represents a step in building practical cloud competency.

## Content Structure

- **Manual Labs**: Step-by-step implementations using the AWS Console, including configuration walkthroughs and architectural decisions
- **Terraform Deployments**: Infrastructure-as-code implementations showcasing automated provisioning and resource management
- **Documentation**: Detailed notes on concepts, challenges encountered, and solutions discovered during each lab
- **Visual References**: Screenshots and diagrams illustrating configurations, architectures, and results

## Approach

The labs progress from foundational services to more complex architectural patterns, with each implementation building on concepts from previous work. Both success and failure cases are documented to capture the full learning experience.

## Technologies

- AWS Services
- Terraform for infrastructure automation
- Various supporting tools and frameworks as needed

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning log and a reference for future projects. The code and documentation reflect real implementations and the iterative process of developing cloud infrastructure skills.
